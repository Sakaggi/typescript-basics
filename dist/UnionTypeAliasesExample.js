//Union Type and Alias in Typescript
var username = 'alex'; //property is of type string
//If we want a property of multiple datatypes, we can use union operator
var pagename = "10";
//When the property is undefined at the declaration, we can use null type
var errorMessage = null;
// The user property can be null or of type userInterface
var user = null;
//These two will mean the same
var id;
var id;
//These two will mean the same
var popularTags = ["dragon", "coffee"];
//this is better and more readable
var popularTags = ["dragon", "coffee"];
var dragonsTag = "dragon";
